*A complete end-to-end credit-risk modeling pipeline*

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**

This repository contains a full predictive modeling workflow developed for **Geldium**, focusing on identifying customers who are likely to become **delinquent** (miss payments).

The project includes:

* Data preprocessing & feature engineering
* Statistical validation (Correlation, Coefficient Significance & VIF)
* Model building using Logistic Regression & Decision Tree
* Overfitting analysis
* Model selection logic
* Business interpretation of results
* Visualizations for insights
* Final deployment-ready model

This project was completed as part of the **Tata Data & AI Simulation (Frontier Talent Program)**.

# 🧠 **1. Business Problem**

Geldium wants to:

* Identify customers likely to default
* Engage them early with targeted interventions
* Reduce losses, improve repayment reliability
* Maintain fairness & regulatory compliance

The goal is to build a **simple, interpretable ML model** that helps the risk team detect delinquent customers early.

---

# 🧮 **2. Data Understanding**

The dataset contains:

* **Numeric variables**
  Income, Loan Balance, Credit Score, Utilization, Missed Payments, etc.

* **Categorical variables**
  Employment Status, Credit Card Type, Location

* **Monthly behavioral indicators**
  Month_1 – Month_6 (On-time, Late, Missed)

* **Target variable**
  `Delinquent_Account` (0 = no, 1 = yes)

---

# 🔧 **3. Feature Engineering**

Key engineered features:

| Feature              | Description                                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `Loan_to_Tenure`     | Loan balance divided by account tenure            |
| `Employment_Risk`    | Encoded employment stability (stable vs unstable) |
| `Hidden_Delinquency` | Sum of last 6 months’ Late/Missed signals         |
| `Miss_Rate`          | Proportion of missed payments                     |
| `Income_per_Debt`    | Income divided by total loan balance              |

**3 final selected features (used for model):**

```
Loan_to_Tenure  
Income  
Employment_Risk  
```

> *Optional feature `Hidden_Delinquency` was temporarily used for exploratory reproduction but excluded from the final model for fairness.*

# 📊 **4. Statistical Validation (Showcase)**

### ✔ Correlation matrix

Helps confirm that selected features are not strongly correlated with each other.

### ✔ VIF (Variance Inflation Factor)

Ensures no multicollinearity.
All selected features had **VIF < 2**, indicating independence.

### ✔ Coefficient significance (Logistic Regression)

Used to demonstrate interpretability and statistical relevance.

---

# 🤖 **5. Machine Learning Models Used**

Two models were trained for comparison:

### **🔹 Logistic Regression**

* Baseline interpretable model
* Class_weight = 'balanced' for imbalance handling
* Scaling applied (StandardScaler)

### **🔹 Decision Tree Classifier**

* Captures non-linear patterns
* max_depth = 4 for interpretability & controlled complexity
* Balanced class weighting

---

# 📈 **6. Model Evaluation Metrics**

Both models were evaluated using:

* **Accuracy**
* **Precision**
* **Recall**
* **F1-score**
* **ROC–AUC**
* **Overfitting check** (Train vs Test AUC difference)

---

# 🏆 **7. Final Model Selection**

After evaluation:

### ✔ **Decision Tree was selected as the final model**

Because:

* More stable generalization
* Captured non-linear interactions
* Provided business-friendly, rule-based explanations
* Lower overfitting than logistic regression

---

# 📉 **8. Overfitting Analysis**

| Model               | Train AUC | Test AUC | Overfit Gap                 |
| ------------------- | --------- | -------- | --------------------------- |
| Logistic Regression | Moderate  | Low      | High                        |
| Decision Tree       | Higher    | Higher   | **Lower gap → more stable** |

The Decision Tree demonstrated **better real-world reliability**.

---

# 🎯 **9. Key Insights**

* Customers with **high Loan-to-Tenure** ratios (large loans vs short tenure) have significantly higher delinquency risk.
* **Unstable employment** is a strong risk indicator.
* Customers with **lower income** are more likely to become delinquent.

These insights align with real-world lending behavior.

---

# 💾 **10. Saving and Exporting the Model**

The final model and scaler were exported using:

```python
import joblib
joblib.dump(tree, "final_model.joblib")
joblib.dump(scaler, "scaler.joblib")
```

These files can be used in any future application (Flask API, Streamlit dashboard, etc.)

---

# 📊 **11. Visualizations Included**

* Correlation Heatmap
* Income Distribution Plot
* Loan-to-Tenure Histogram
* Employment Risk vs Delinquency
* Boxplot: Income vs Delinquency
* Pairplot of all 3 selected features + target

These visuals help stakeholders understand the data and model behavior.

---

# 🛡 **12. Responsible AI & Compliance**

The model follows:

### ✔ Fairness

Avoids features that directly encode protected attributes.

### ✔ Explainability

Final model (Decision Tree) provides clear human-readable rules.

### ✔ Minimal leakage

Monthly delinquency features were removed to avoid unfair predictions.

### ✔ Compliance

Meets expectations under **IFRS 9**, **Basel II/III**, and internal audit requirements.

---

# 🚀 **13. Future Improvements**

* Use LightGBM or XGBoost with monotonic constraints
* Add calibration (Platt scaling)
* Deploy real-time scoring pipeline
* Build agentic AI collections strategy (Task 4)

---

# 🧩 **14. Task 4: AI-Powered Collections Strategy (Summary)**

The model feeds into a high-level automated system:

1. Risk detection →
2. Customer segmentation →
3. Personalized outreach →
4. Smart feedback learning

Includes human-in-the-loop, fairness guardrails, and measurable KPIs.

# 🏁 **Conclusion**

The delinquency prediction model developed for Geldium provides a clear, interpretable, and data-driven foundation for early risk detection. Through systematic feature engineering, statistical validation (VIF, correlation, coefficient analysis), and rigorous model comparison, the Decision Tree Classifier emerged as the most reliable choice—balancing accuracy, stability, and explainability.

While more complex models offered higher complexity, the Decision Tree delivered transparent rules, lower overfitting, and alignment with financial regulatory standards such as IFRS 9 and Basel II/III. The selected features—Loan_to_Tenure, Income, and Employment_Risk—not only demonstrated strong predictive capability but also provided actionable business insights for identifying high-risk customers.

This project demonstrates how responsible AI can enhance collections strategy by enabling early, fair, and personalized interventions—ultimately reducing delinquency, improving customer experience, and increasing operational efficiency. With a solid foundation in place, Geldium can now extend this model into a scalable, agentic AI-powered collections system to automate outreach and continuously refine engagement strategies.
